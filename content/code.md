# rTLS

[rTLS](https://github.com/Antguz/rTLS) is an R package that compiles a series of tools to process and calculate metrics on point clouds derived from terrestrial LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data. This started as a personal hobby, but due to its current use, we decided to formalize their routines.

<br/>

This package is carried out also by [Dr. Arturo Sanchez](https://www.ualberta.ca/faculties/centresinstitutes/centre-for-earth-observation-sciences/participants/arturo) (University of Alberta) and [Ronny Hernandez](http://ronnyhdez.rbind.io/). The current development of rTLS is focussed on four major processes applied on point clouds: i) filtering, ii) voxelization and their visualization, iii) point neighborhood features, and iv) optimal voxel or sphere size.

<br/>

Take a look to its current state at [github](https://github.com/Antguz/rTLS) as well as to a [poster](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333204427_Relationship_between_tree_architectural_metrics_and_its_fractal_dimension_using_Terrestrial_Laser_Scanning) presented at the TLS in Forest Ecology conference.
