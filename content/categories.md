## Detection, contribution, and local variability of lianas and trees in the Neotropical dry forest.

<br/>

This project is part of my Ph.D. thesis under the supervision of Dr. Arturo Sanchez at the University of Alberta. The NSERC of the Government of Canada currently funds it. In general, the project looks to create interdisciplinary approaches that help to evaluate the local variability, detect the presence, and quantify the contribution of lianas and trees in the Tropical Dry Forest (TDF). These interdisciplinary are being created linking fields such as remote sensing, plant physiology, ecology, and modeling. Specifically, this reseach aims to answer the following questions: i) how is the leaf temperature variation of lianas and trees at the canopy, and how this variation may affect the ecosystem productivity? ii) Is the detection of lianas and trees based on long-wave infrared signatures a better approach than the conventional detection using visible-near infrared signatures? iii) How is the relationship between spectral signatures and functional traits of leaves of lianas and trees, and how this relationship may affect the upscale of information to ecosystems? And iv) how much is the contribution of lianas and trees to the overall ecosystem productivity?
